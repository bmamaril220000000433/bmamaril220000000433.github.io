          <p class="Desc">I have learn many things about HTML. Firstly the basics. I have learned to always declare the DOCTYPE followed by the structure of
            html which consist of head, body and footer. And next the basic tags. The most commonly used is p, h1, div and img. There are more that I have not mentioned but those
            are the tags I'm familiar with. And more things I have learned which is inline tags, attributes, headings, lists, tabls, blocks and links and references. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="Desc">The challenges I have encountered so far is actually coding html. There are a lot of things I have to memorized like tags so I just familiarized them.
            So far I have been having difficultly maybe due to me being lazy and having little motivation to learn. I had to rely on researching and reading the resources for
            html guides. Overall I think HTML should be easy to code so long as I keep learning and keep myself motivated.</p>

          </div> 
          <p class="Desc">CSS one I didn't find it fun to learn. Because mainly there is so many attributes to use and memorized. CSS is truly a designer coding. I'm still learning
            the basics of CSS. There is so much to learn that I havent been discovered. The ones I remember is the selectors. I found out there are hierarchy of specifity that CSS prioritize
            to modify. starting from the lowest is class, types then ids. Learn CSS module in code academy helped me a bit of learning of designing the website.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="Desc">This is probably the hardest challenges I'm currently learning yet. CSS has a lot of properties like ALOT. padding, margin, display, fonts, width, height, there is so many
            possiblities in CSS. It is draining me out that there are probably more than 200 attributes to this alone. So Overall I am not a fan of CSS but I'm trying </p>
